Tošić</a>, Full Professor from <a href="https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/en">University of Belgrade – School of Electrical Engineering</a>. It is used for symbolic analysis of linear electronic circuits in free software.
This is supplemental data for conference paper titled "Symbolic analysis of linear electric circuits with Maxima CAS" presented at the <a href="http://pssoh.etf.bg.ac.rs/">PSSOH</a> 2019 conference. Paper can be found at Zenodo repositorium (Tošić V. Dejan, & Potrebić M. Milka. (2019). Symbolic analysis of linear electric circuits with Maxima CAS. Zenodo. DOI: <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3464103#.XY-nt2ZS_IU">10.5281/zenodo.3464103</a>).
This repository contains Maxima file of SALECx software code.

On November 2, 2019 at the University of Belgrade - School of Electrical Engineering workshop titled "Symbolic circuit analysis on Android" was held as part of post-conference PSSOH events.
